          <h2>How To Make Money In Norland</h2>
          <h4>Retail Sales Profit</h4>
          <p>
            One major way of earning bonuses from Norland is the profit on
            retailing (reselling) the products you buy from Norland. That
            Norland has amazing products which basically sell themselves cannot
            be overemphasized. It is relatively easier to find customers for
            your Norland products. You can sell the products at a membership
            price with a little profit. This gives members a major source of
            income.
          </p>
          <h4>Retail Purchase Bonus</h4>
          <p>
            Another major way of earning bonuses from Norland is that you get a
            whooping 20% bonus on the amount spent on all subsequent purchases
            after registration. This bonus is paid monthly in accordance with
