# Ecommerce-store
An E-commerce store built using Html CSS and Javascript
I created this E-commerce store for a client who wants more visibilty for her business,
she wasn't making sales so I decided to create an e-commerce store.
Tech stack used
Html for the structure of the web
css for the styling 
JS for interaction with the web
I also optimized the images and SEO ranked contents.
